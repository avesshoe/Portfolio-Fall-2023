# Portfolio-Fall-2023
Portfolio DS241, A folder of all (most of all) my R Studio Notebooks! Enjoy.

Project 1: nyc02

In this project, I used the packages tidyverse, here, janitor, and nycflights13 to draw comclustions from flight data. 
With the data, I firstly filtered the data to get the desired variables from the dataset. From there, I was able to attempt to create visuals. There were errors in my code and I was not able to get all the visuals to run, but the general idea from this project taught me how to tidy data and mutate it to find the variables I want to draw conclusions from.

Project 2: Lab4

This project was to see if there is correlation bwtween La Quinta and Denny's. The packages used in this project was tidyverse, readr, here, and dplyr. Just like the project above, the first step is mutate data and organize the data so the two data sets could be compared to each other. 

Project 3: Homework 1

This project is one of the assigned homeworks to use correlation plots. The packages used in this project wasa knitr, tidyverse, ggcorrplot, corrplot2, broom . The biggest takeaway from this project was using visualization tools to view correlation. Additionally, this projected required the use of mutation to filter for the desired variables.

Project 4: Asynch09_11

This project is one of the asynchronous classes to demonstrate the visualizations that can be produced. Just like every other project, the packages used were tidyverse, here, janitor, and nycflights13. Ultimately, this project was to demonstrate how to use these packages to visualize data. Histograms and bar plots were the most drawn from the data sets. 

Project 5: experiments_11_06

In this project, we introduced packages such as openmeteo and lubridate. This project is one of the experimental projects used to demonstrate how to join two data sets as well as shrink the data size to a more manipulative amount, use data from online sources (the weather in this case), and create visualizations for different variables and their locations. 

Project 6: Final Project

In the final project, we were tasked with finding a solution to increasing ridership for BikeshareDC. This project required me and my team to make assumptions, find a sector that we believed could be improved, find sources of data, create models that demonstrate our findingss, then interpret its meaning and signifigance. This project required an immense amount of time and teamwork to work through the data science projcess of solving an abstract question.
